# Sans Terminal Indexer
This is a program currently in development that I am creating to help make indexing of SANS textbooks easier that is based off of [Voltaire](https://voltaire.publickey.io/). 

Currently the indexer has the following features
- Checks to see if you have any indexes in the current directory (Checks for .csv files)
    - If so it will ask you to select which index you would like to use, if not it will create a new one.
- Takes input in the format of **Term, definition, page number**. The three fields can be any an information you want in your index but it must be delimited by commas.
- You index is saved in the directory the program is launched from everytime you enter a new entry

# This is still a work in progress.
